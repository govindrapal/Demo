7 key principles that ensure effective testing:
1: Testing Shows Presence of Defects
Description:
Testing can demonstrate the presence of defects but not their absence.
key point :
No amount of testing can guarantee that the software is completely free of defects.
Example: 
Testing reveals a bug in the login feature of an application 
that causes it to crash under certain conditions. 
This defect is identified, but testing cannot guarantee that no other bugs exist

2: Exhaustive Testing is Impossible:
Description:
It is not possible to test all possible inputs and scenarios.
key point :
Focus on risk-based and prioritized testing to cover the most critical aspects.
Example:
In a complex system with millions of possible input combinations,
it's impractical to test every single scenario. Instead, testing focuses on representative cases and risk-based approaches to maximize coverage within practical limits.
In a banking application with numerous account types and transaction methods,
it's not feasible to test every possible combination. Instead, the team uses representative test cases and prioritizes critical scenarios

3: Early Testing:
Description:
Begin testing as early as possible in the software development lifecycle
key point :
Early testing helps identify defects sooner and reduces costs.
Example: 
During the development of a new application, the testing team starts writing test cases and testing early prototypes. This helps catch issues early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later

4: Defect Clustering :
Description:
A small number of modules or features typically contain the majority of defects.
key point :
Focus on testing the areas with higher defect density.
Example:
In a financial software application, most defects might be found in the calculation module, 
even though there are many modules. This principle suggests that defects often cluster in specific areas, so focused testing on those areas can be more effective.
Most defects are found in the payment module of an e-commerce application, indicating that this area requires more focused testing and scrutiny compared to other modules.

5.Pesticide Paradox:
Description:Running the same set of tests will not continue to find new defects.
key point: Regularly update and diversify your test cases to find new defects.
Example: 
Running the same set of tests repeatedly will not uncover new defects. 
To find new bugs, testers need to create new test cases or modify existing ones. For example, if previous tests always pass, introducing boundary tests might reveal new issues.
If running the same set of regression tests always results in a pass, introducing new types of tests, such as performance or stress tests, can help uncover additional issues.

6.Testing is Context-Dependent
Description:Testing approaches vary depending on the context of the software and its environment
key point: 
Tailor your testing strategy to the specific needs and constraints of the project.
Example: 
Testing a mobile app requires different approaches compared to testing a web application.
Mobile testing must consider various devices and screen sizes, while web testing might focus more on browser compatibility and responsiveness.

7: Absence-of-Errors Fallacy
Description : Even if no defects are found, it does not mean the software is ready for release.
key point :
The software must meet business requirements and provide value to users, not just be defect-free.
Example:
An application may pass all tests and appear to be bug-free, but it might still not meet the user's needs or business requirements.
Testing ensures that defects are found, but it does not guarantee that the product will fulfill its intended purpose if requirements are not met.
